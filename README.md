### Installation
- Download the release APK from the releases page
- Install the APK
- Open up Lumi :)

### Troubleshooting

**Minky does not show up :(**

Wait for more, If it doesn't load at all, try clearing storage and cache.

**The image doesn't download :|**

Try going to Settings and allowing external storage permissions for Lumi. (this only really happens on older android versions)
